          I am a passionate developer with a strong background in computer
          science. Currently, I'm focused on web development and building
          scalable applications. I enjoy working on backend systems,
          implementing efficient architectures, and optimizing workflows for
          better performance. With hands-on experience in DevOps practices and
          AWS cloud services, I am able to deploy and manage applications with
          high reliability and scalability. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new tools
          and technologies that help automate processes and improve the
          development lifecycle. I am excited about building robust and
          maintainable systems, and I look forward to leveraging cloud
          infrastructure to drive innovation in the tech industry.
